      "Hi, my name is Jack Flannery. I'm a girl dad, husband and full stack web developer. I live in New Jersey with my wife Danielle and our baby daughter Olivia. Besides spending time with my family I enjoy tinkering with computer software, hiking, and lefty politics. I try go snowboarding whenever I can and I'm looking forward to introducing Olivia to the sport. We love to go on road trips across the country, at least before the pandemic hit. Our goal is to travel the world, and see as much of it as possible, and maybe live to see the end of capitalism.",
      "I'm a full stack web developer at Braidio. We're making some really interesting products and we use some pretty neat tools like React, React Native, Redux and Ruby on Rails. I've always been drawn to computer programming I'm very lucky to be able to do something I enjoy for a living. Braidio is fully remote company so I can work from wherever I want, which just happens to be at home most of the time. When I'm not working from home, you might find me at Cowerks, a great coworking space in Asbury Park, NJ.",
      "I'm usually working on various side projects. You can find my blog here. I mostly write web development tutorials on topics that I'm currenty working on, or any topics I'm interested in and don't get to work with with in my day job.",
